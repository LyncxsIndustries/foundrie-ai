# 17 - Custom Edge Types

## Goal

Implement UML-aware custom edges and markers.

## Context To Read First

- `context/project-overview.md`
- `context/architecture-context.md`
- `context/ui-context.md`
- `context/code-standards.md`
- `context/ai-workflow-rules.md`
- `context/progress-tracker.md`

## Context7 Docs To Check

- React Flow `/xyflow/web`

Use installed Context7 skills or:

```bash
npx ctx7 library <library> "<specific question>"
npx ctx7 docs <libraryId> "<specific question>"
```

## Implementation

- Create association, aggregation, composition, inheritance, and dependency edges.
- Create sequence sync, async, and return message edges.
- Create crow's-foot ER edges.
- Create C4 relationship edges.
- Support labels, marker styles, click targets, and selection states.

## Scope Limits

- Do not implement later feature specs early.
- Do not introduce undocumented architecture changes.
- Do not bypass the storage, auth, AI, or Context7 rules in the context files.

## Check When Done

- The feature works within its defined scope.
- Relevant library docs were checked with Context7.
- Types are strict and external input is validated.
- Access control is enforced where data is read or mutated.
- `context/progress-tracker.md` is updated.
- `npm run build` passes once application code exists.
- All CodeRabbit reviews must pass. In case of errors, iterate and fix by checking official documentation from Context7 and all available skills. Do not rely on personal AI training data as it might be outdated. For every feature, always check documentation, skills, and research for all implementations.
