# 16 - Custom Node Types

## Goal

Implement type-aware nodes for UML, C4, data, and infrastructure diagrams.

## Context To Read First

- `context/project-overview.md`
- `context/architecture-context.md`
- `context/ui-context.md`
- `context/code-standards.md`
- `context/ai-workflow-rules.md`
- `context/progress-tracker.md`

## Context7 Docs To Check

- React Flow `/xyflow/web`

Use installed Context7 skills or:

```bash
npx ctx7 library <library> "<specific question>"
npx ctx7 docs <libraryId> "<specific question>"
```

## Implementation

- Create one node component per major shape family.
- Implement class/interface/abstract compartment nodes.
- Implement sequence lifeline, actor, activation, and fragment nodes.
- Implement ER entity, weak entity, attribute, and relationship nodes.
- Implement C4 person, system, container, database, and external system nodes.
- Implement microservice, gateway, message bus, database, load balancer, and cache nodes.
- Validate node data before rendering.

## Scope Limits

- Do not implement later feature specs early.
- Do not introduce undocumented architecture changes.
- Do not bypass the storage, auth, AI, or Context7 rules in the context files.

## Check When Done

- The feature works within its defined scope.
- Relevant library docs were checked with Context7.
- Types are strict and external input is validated.
- Access control is enforced where data is read or mutated.
- `context/progress-tracker.md` is updated.
- `npm run build` passes once application code exists.
- All CodeRabbit reviews must pass. In case of errors, iterate and fix by checking official documentation from Context7 and all available skills. Do not rely on personal AI training data as it might be outdated. For every feature, always check documentation, skills, and research for all implementations.
